We only send emails to people who have authorized us to contact them, either directly, or through a third party. We do not send unsolicited commercial emails, because we hate spam as much as you do. By submitting your email address, you also agree to allow us to use your email address for customer audience targeting on sites like Facebook, where we display custom advertising to specific people who have opted-in to receive communications from us. Email addresses submitted only through the order processing page will be used for the sole purpose of sending you information and updates pertaining to your order.

Note: If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.</p><h2 data-v-75c22c78>How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h2><p data-v-75c22c78>We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide Vue Playground to you and fulfill the purposes described in this policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and who carries out services on our behalf. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we’ll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can&#39;t identify you.</p><h2 data-v-75c22c78>How Do We Protect Your Information?</h2><p data-v-75c22c78>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) is never kept on file. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to Vue Playground or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p><h2 data-v-75c22c78>Could my information be transferred to other countries?</h2><p data-v-75c22c78>Vue Playground is incorporated in Norway.

To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, by using any of the above, you voluntarily consent to the trans-border transfer and hosting of such information.</p><h2 data-v-75c22c78>Is the information collected through the Vue Playground Service secure?</h2><p data-v-75c22c78>We take precautions to protect the security of your information. We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your information. However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems. In addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect your personal information, you agree that intentional misconduct will be the standards used to measure our compliance with that duty.</p><h2 data-v-75c22c78>Can I update or correct my information?</h2><p data-v-75c22c78>The rights you have to request updates or corrections to the information Vue Playground collects depend on your relationship with Vue Playground.

Promptly after receiving your request, all personal information stored in databases we actively use, and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably and technically practicable.</p><p data-v-75c22c78>If you are an end user and wish to update, delete, or receive any information we have about you, you may do so by contacting the organization of which you are a customer.</p><h2 data-v-75c22c78>Personnel</h2><p data-v-75c22c78>If you are a Vue Playground worker or applicant, we collect information you voluntarily provide to us.

Our customers’ data is important irrespective of where they are located, which is why we have implemented GDPR controls as our baseline standard for all our operations worldwide.</p><h2 data-v-75c22c78>What is personal data?</h2><p data-v-75c22c78>Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum of information that could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces of information, to identify a person. Personal data extends beyond a person’s name or email address. Some examples include financial information, political opinions, genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual orientation, and ethnicity.</p><p data-v-75c22c78>The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:</p><ul data-v-75c22c78><li data-v-75c22c78>Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and transparent way and should only be used in a way that a person would reasonably expect.</li><li data-v-75c22c78>Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose and it should only be used for that purpose. Organizations must specify why they need the personal data when they collect it.</li><li data-v-75c22c78>Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its purpose.</li><li data-v-75c22c78>People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data. They can also request a copy of their data, and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another organization.</li></ul><h2 data-v-75c22c78>Why is GDPR important?</h2><p data-v-75c22c78>GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect individuals&#39; personal data that they collect and process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing greater fines for breach. Beyond these facts it&#39;s simply the right thing to do. At Vue Playground we strongly believe that your data privacy is very important and we already have solid security and privacy practices in place that go beyond the requirements of this new regulation.</p><h2 data-v-75c22c78>Individual Data Subject&#39;s Rights - Data Access, Portability and Deletion</h2><p data-v-75c22c78>We are committed to helping our customers meet the data subject rights requirements of GDPR. Vue Playground processes or stores all personal data in fully vetted, DPA compliant vendors. We do store all conversation and personal data for up to 6 years unless your account is deleted. In which case, we dispose of all data in accordance with our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, but we will not hold it longer than 60 days.</p><p data-v-75c22c78>We are aware that if you are working with EU customers, you need to be able to provide them with the ability to access, update, retrieve and remove personal data.
