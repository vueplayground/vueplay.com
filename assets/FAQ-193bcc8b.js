We have planned to build galleries, sliders and other cool components to fill your needs. We also have plans to add community built components, but this currently needs some more work. </p></div><div class="bg-slate-50 border mb-6 rounded-lg p-8"><p class="pb-4 text-xl font-medium"> I found a premade Tailwind Component where i copied the code, how can I get it into my Vue Play application? </p><p class="text-lg"> You can paste pre-made tailwind components into the playground using the Context Menu (Three Dots) or Keyboard Shortcuts [CTRL + V] or [CMD + V] on mac while you are in the playground. </p></div><div class="bg-slate-50 border mb-6 rounded-lg p-8"><p class="pb-4 text-xl font-medium"> I have a question, found a bug or have a feature request.
