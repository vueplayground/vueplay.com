We have planned to build galleries, sliders and other cool components to fill your needs. We also have plans to add community built components, but this currently needs some more work. </p></div><div style="margin-bottom:10px;display:inline-block;"><p style="margin-top:15px;" class="py-2 text-lg font-medium"> I found a premade Tailwind Component where i copied the code, how can I get it into my Vue Play application? </p><p class="text-lg"> You can paste pre-made tailwind components into the playground using the Context Menu (Three Dots) or Keyboard Shortcuts [CTRL + V] or [CMD + V] on mac while you are in the playground. </p></div><div style="margin-bottom:10px;display:inline-block;"><p style="margin-top:15px;" class="py-2 text-lg font-medium"> I have a question, found a bug or have a feature request. What do I do? </p><p class="text-lg"> We are working on a community page which is coming soon to handle support, feature request and bug reports.
